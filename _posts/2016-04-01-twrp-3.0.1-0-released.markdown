We need your help! The bulk of TWRP work is done by 3 people on a volunteer basis. We have pushed most of our device files to [our github](http://github.com/TeamWin/) and we have [a gerrit instance](http://gerrit.twrp.me). If you have the ability, please help us maintain our official devices and/or add your device to our official device list. Thanks in advance!

[You can track the progress of builds here](https://jenkins.twrp.me)
