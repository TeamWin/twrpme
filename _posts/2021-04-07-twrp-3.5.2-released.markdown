TWRP {{ page.version }} is out now for most currently supported devices.

This release is to fix a regression error for digest checking. Thanks to epicX for his
hard work fixing this issue.

Also thanks to megafont29 for updating Russian translations.

You can see the device builds under their respective Jenkins view at https://jenkins.twrp.me.

We need your help! The bulk of TWRP work is done by a handful of people on a volunteer basis. We have pushed most of our device files to [our github](http://github.com/TeamWin/) and we have [a gerrit instance](http://gerrit.twrp.me). If you have the ability, please help us maintain our official devices and/or add your device to our official device list. Thanks in advance!

Head over to the [devices page](http://twrp.me/Devices) to find install instructions and download links.
