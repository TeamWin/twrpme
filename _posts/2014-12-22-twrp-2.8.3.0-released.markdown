TWRP 2.8.3.0 is out now for all currently supported devices.

What's new in 2.8.3.0:

  * MTP fixes and improvements - you can now copy zips to the root of storage - thanks to _that
  * MTP will now tell the host PC that storage is removed instead of disabling MTP completely
  * MTP will now report the correct max file size based on the file system in use to the host PC (may fix transfer of large files)
  * Update and improve fix permissions and make fixing contexts optional
  * Update SuperSU in TWRP to 2.40 and update install process
  * Make TWRP work properly on AArch64 (Nexus 9 is now built in true 64-bit binaries and libraries)
  * Attempt to set correct permissions and contexts on all files placed in storage so backups will show in Android
  * Fix kernel panic during MTP start on some devices
  * Support unicode fonts on devices with True Type Font support
  * Fix slider value not showing sometimes (vibration settings page)
  * Toggle MTP off during adb sideload to set correct USB IDs
  * Reduce library requirements for 5.0 L decrypt
  * Other minor fixes and improvements
