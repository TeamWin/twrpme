TWRP 2.8.4.0 is out now for all currently supported devices.

What's new in 2.8.4.0:

  * Add flashing of boot and recovery images via the TWRP GUI (Find the Images button on the Install page)
  * Fix some MTP related crashes and bugs
  * Eliminate TWRP toggling USB IDs during boot if MTP is enabled
  * Fix various adb sideload issues
  * Improve threading of actions
  * Eliminate separate thread for screen timeout
  * Update libblkid to 2.25.0
  * Use power button as back button on watch themes for easier navigation
  * Add mutex locking to data manager
  * Improve custom theme handling on encrypted devices
  * Allow the stock theme to be offset by build flags so we can center a lower res theme on a higher res screen especially for watches with round screens

Head over to the [devices page](http://twrp.me/Devices) to find install instructions and download links.
