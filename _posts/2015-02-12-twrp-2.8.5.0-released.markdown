TWRP {{ page.version }} is out now for all currently supported devices.

What's new in {{ page.version }}:

  * Scale the GUI - TWRP can read the theme's resolution and scale it up or down to fit the theme to your screen's resolution
  * Backups can now be cancelled while the backup is in progress (does not include restore because we don't want to leave your device in a bad state)
  * Improve thread handling and move input handling into the main rendering thread to improve stability
  * Make MTP work even if unplugged and plugged back in
  * Unify scrollable list code and make kinetic scrolling feel more natural
  * Fix handling of mapped zip files for OTA updates (CM12 updater)
  * USB keyboards should now work on all devices that support USB host mode via a USB OTG cable
  * Other small fixes and improvements

Head over to the [devices page](http://twrp.me/Devices) to find install instructions and download links.
