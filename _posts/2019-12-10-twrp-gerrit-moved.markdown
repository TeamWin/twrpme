We are moving the TWRP repository from gerrit.omnirom.org to gerrit.twrp.me retaining the android_bootable_recovery project name. If you have any open Change Requests on gerrit.omnirom.org and would like to see them reviewed, please cherry-pick and push them to the repository on gerrit.twrp.me

Original project URL: https://gerrit.omnirom.org/#/q/project:android_bootable_recovery
New project URL: https://gerrit.twrp.me/q/project:+android_bootable_recovery

Thanks for all your continued support to the TWRP OSS Project.
