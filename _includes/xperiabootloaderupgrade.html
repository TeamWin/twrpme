<p class="text">Since december 2015 sony provides a <a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/2015/12/10/recovery-mode-available-on-wider-range-of-unlocked-xperia-devices-video/" target="_blank">new bootloader</a> which allow direct recovery access from cold boot only.</p>
<p class="text">The <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=66380030&postcount=2" target="_blank">upgrade process</a> is heavy as it reflashes a full stock rom on the device, wiping all data, (twrp doesn't backup /data/media ie /sdcard) but it's highly recommended as it provides direct access to the recovery. </p>
