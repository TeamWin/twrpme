<div class='page-heading'>Heimdall Install Method (No Root Required) (on linux PC):</div>
<a id='odin'></a>
<hr />
<p class="text">You will need to download and <a href="https://www.codeur.com">install Heimdall</a> on your PC. On ubuntu you can simply run:</p>
<p class="code">sudo apt-get install heimdall-flash heimdall-flash-frontend </p>
<p class="text">On other distributions you can simply recompile heimdall following <a href="https://github.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/tree/master/Linux">the procedure described in the offical github</a></p>
<p class="text">
 Once you have Heimdall installed, download the proper .tar file for your device from the download link above and untar it to extract the .img file:
</p>
<p class="code">tar -xf twrp-{version}-{device}.img.tar </p>

<p class="text">
 Power off your device. Turn on your device using the proper key combo to get into download mode and attach the device to your computer via a USB cable. Then run the following command
 </p>
 <p class="code">heimdall flash --RECOVERY recovery.img</p>

<p class="text">Note many devices will replace your custom recovery automatically during first boot. To prevent this, use <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> to find the proper key combo to enter recovery and hold the key combo and boot to TWRP right after running the previous command right when the screen turns off. Once TWRP is booted, TWRP will patch the stock ROM to prevent the stock ROM from replacing TWRP. If you don't follow this step, you will have to repeat the install.</p>
