<div class='page-heading'>Installation:</div>
To install TWRP on Alcatel Tetra, you first need to unlock the bootloader.
The process is a bit more involved for this device than it is on most others.
Thanks to PizzaG and LgPWN'd we have a way to access and unlock the bootloader.
Simply follow this guide [on XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/alcatel-tetra-aio-start-here.3965337/) labeled fastboot fix.
Once you have unlocked the bootloader, you can follow the steps in the guide to finish installing TWRP on your Alcatel Tetra.
