<div class='page-heading'>Bootable SD Card (No Root Required):</div>
<hr />
<p class="text">If you prefer not to modify any of the stock software, you can create a proper bootable sdcard for your device and copy the acclaim-sdcard file to the root of the sdcard and rename it to recovery.img and/or altboot.img and boot TWRP using the cyanoboot menu from your sdcard.</p>
